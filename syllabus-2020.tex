\section*{Course Description}
This is a second Ph.D. course in applied econometrics though advanced undergraduates are welcome. The main audience are PhD students not studying economics or finance at Stern (Accounting, Marketing, TOPS, Strategy) as well as other students at NYU (including Ph.D. students at Wagner).

The focus is on microeconometrics and panel data. It is a continuation of Prof. Scott's course, though once the basics are covered we will have more opportunity to explore topics related to student intererst. 

\begin{description}
\item[Problem Sets:] I have designed the problem sets in R, though you are free to use whichever statistical software you would like. 
\end{description}

\section*{Books}
I will follow two main textbooks.
\begin{itemize}
\item Greene (2017). \textit{Econometric Analysis}. ISBN: 0134461363
\item Tibshirani, Hastie, Friedman (2016), \textit{The Elements of Statistical Learning}. ISBN: 0387848576. Available online at \url{https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf}.
\item Hansen. Econometrics (2020). \url{https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~bhansen/econometrics/Econometrics.pdf}.
\end{itemize} 

\section*{Course Policy}
You are expected to attend every lecture and it is expected that you have done the reading BEFORE the class. This is a Ph.D. course which means you will be expected to read a lot on your own.
\subsection*{Grading Policy}
\begin{itemize}
\item 60\% of your grade will be performance on 6 problem sets (10\% each).
\item 30\% of your grade will be performance on the final exam.
\item 10\% of your grade will be participation in class.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Academic Dishonesty Policy}
Don't cheat. It is helpful to work with a partner on debugging code, but my expectation is that assignments are 100\% your own work (including computer code).
